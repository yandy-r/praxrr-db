# Lidarr v1 Support Contract

## Purpose

This document is the Task 1.1 implementation contract for Lidarr v1 support in
`praxrr-db`. It defines the non-negotiable v1 boundary, release blockers, and
verification steps that downstream SQL tasks must satisfy.

## Contract Baseline

- Contract scope is for the first Lidarr-enabled database release only.
- Required arr discriminator value is `arr_type='lidarr'`.
- Compatibility gate is `pcd.json.praxrr.minimum_version = 2.1.0`.
- V1 path is shared-table extension; if schema validation forces dedicated
  `lidarr_*` entities, publication is blocked until re-planning is complete.

## In Scope for v1

- Add Lidarr publication metadata in `pcd.json` (`arr_types` + minimum version
  gate).
- Seed Lidarr rows for the minimum complete dataset:
  - quality profiles
  - custom formats
  - custom format conditions
  - quality profile to custom format score mappings
  - quality definitions/mappings required by selected Lidarr profiles
- Keep SQL additive and replay-safe with deterministic duplicate guards.
- Produce validation evidence mapped to every contract requirement.

## Explicitly Out of Scope for v1

- Lidarr metadata profile seeding.
- Lidarr release profile seeding.
- SignalR/event-stream integration.
- Automatic OpenAPI client generation pipeline.
- Non-essential schema redesign beyond the shared-table path.

## Release Blockers

Release is blocked if any of the following is true:

- `pcd.json` does not include `lidarr` and minimum version `2.1.0`.
- Shared-table schema path is not validated (or requires dedicated entities
  without approved re-plan).
- Minimum complete dataset checks fail.
- Duplicate/idempotency checks fail.
- Out-of-scope features are introduced in v1 ops.
- Consumer compatibility evidence for `praxrr >= 2.1.0` is missing.

## Minimum Complete Dataset

The dataset is considered complete only when all checks pass.

## Handoff for SQL Tasks

- Treat this file as immutable baseline input for Tasks 1.2 onward.
- Resolve `<*_target>` placeholders through Task 1.3 schema-gate outputs before
  writing SQL.
- If any task finds a conflict with this contract, stop implementation, record
  the conflict, and re-plan before changing SQL scope.
